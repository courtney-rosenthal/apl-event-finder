# To Do

* remove ".html" from pages (we DO want to see source, not formatted)
* complete extractLocation()
* convert EventScraper exceptions to log messages
* change RecommendedAge from Period to Int (years)
* verify EventDateTime types are good for searching
* use test ES index for tests (add prefix to index name)
* implement minimal application to do a single-pass scrape
